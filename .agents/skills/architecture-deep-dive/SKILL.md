# Architecture Deep Dive

## When to use this

- "Explain the architecture of this project"
- "How does the widget registry work?"
- "Where should I implement X?"
- "What does registry.ts do?"
- "How are widgets discovered / loaded?"

## Instructions

Open the reference file for the full deep dive. Key facts to front-load:

- The registry lives in `app/src/core/registry.ts` — do **not** modify its public API
- Every widget is a **pure function** in its own folder under `app/src/widgets/<name>/`
- Widgets self-register at module load via `register()` — no central manifest needed
- `app/src/widgets/index.ts` is the only place that imports widget modules (triggers registration)
